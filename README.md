4. Under **Source**, select `Deploy from a branch`.

**Click that link to open your live app!**
You can now share this URL with your phone or friends.

## 🔄 How to Sync Data (Local to Online)

Because this app runs in your browser, data is stored separately on each device/website.
To move your data from Local (PC) to Online (GitHub Pages):

1. **On Local (PC):**
   - Open the app.
   - Go to **Transactions** tab.
   - Click **📊 Export Excel**.
   - A file named `Keuangan-yyyy-mm-dd.xlsx` will download.

2. **On Online (GitHub Pages):**
   - Open your hosted app link.
   - Go to **Settings** tab.
   - Under **Import Data**, click **📄 Choose File...**.
   - Select the `Keuangan-....xlsx` file you just downloaded.
   - Done! Your transactions and settings are now synced.

## 🔐 Security (PIN Protection)

Your financial data is private. To protect it:

1. Open the app (Local or Online).
2. Go to the **Settings** tab.
3. Look for the **Security** section.
4. Click **Setup PIN**, enter a numeric code (e.g., `1234`), and click **Save**.
5. **Next time you open the app**, you will be asked for your PIN before seeing any data!

> [!NOTE]
> Your PIN is saved securely as a "hash" (a digital fingerprint). It is **not** stored as a readable number on GitHub, ensuring your real password remains secret even in a public repository.

## 🎨 Customization (Optional)

Want to change colors? Edit `style.css`:

```css
/* Change the main color (line 12) */
