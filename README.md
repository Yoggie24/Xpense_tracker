## 📂 Files Explained (Simple!)

```
simple-money-tracker/
├── index.html    ← The page structure (what you see)
├── style.css     ← The design (how it looks)
├── script.js     ← The functionality (how it works)
└── README.md     ← This file (instructions)
```

### What Each File Does:

**index.html** - The Structure
- Creates the form to add transactions
- Shows the balance
- Displays the list of transactions

**style.css** - The Design
- Makes it look beautiful
- Purple gradient background

- Works on mobile and PC

**script.js** - The Brain

## 💾 Where is My Data Saved?

Your data is saved in your **browser's localStorage**. This means:

✅ **Pros:**
- No internet needed
- No database setup
- Fast and simple
- Private (only on your device)

⚠️ **Important:**
- Data is saved per browser
- If you clear browser data, transactions are deleted
- Different browsers = different data
- To backup: use the browser's export feature (coming soon!)

## 🎨 Customization (Optional)

Want to change colors? Edit `style.css`:

```css
/* Change the main color (line 12) */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);

/* Try different colors: */
/* Green: #11998e 0%, #38ef7d 100% */
/* Orange: #f46b45 0%, #eea849 100% */
/* Blue: #4facfe 0%, #00f2fe 100% */
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Page doesn't open

### Problem: Data disappeared
**Solution:** Don't clear browser cache/cookies. Your data is stored there.

### Problem: Doesn't work on phone
